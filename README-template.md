### What I learned

```css
body {
  background: url('/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg'),hsl(225,100%,94%);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  }
.card{
  border-radius: 0.8rem;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 2px 6px 31px 0px hsl(225,100%,94%);
}  
.content{
    padding: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 1.1rem;
}
.plan {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    background: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    padding: 1em;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    gap: 1rem;
}
.plan div {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn the sectioning in HTML and flexbox in CSS for a good presentation and that my page is perfect to be responsive. But also practice more to better know the differences that are between the values in %, px, vh, vw, rem, em.
